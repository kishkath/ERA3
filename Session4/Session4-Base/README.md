# Fashion MNIST Training System Documentation

## Overview
This system provides a web-based interface for training and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Fashion MNIST dataset. It features real-time training visualization, interactive controls, and live logging capabilities.

## Features

### 1. Real-Time Training Visualization
- Live loss plot with floating-point epoch markers
- Dynamic x-axis scaling that shows progress within epochs
- Smooth line visualization without individual points
- Auto-updating chart with configurable history length

### 2. Interactive Training Controls
- Dataset preparation with one-click download
- Start/Stop training functionality
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Model prediction visualization

### 3. Live Logging System
- Real-time log updates (6 updates per epoch)
- Timestamped entries
- Scrollable log container with custom styling
- Auto-scrolling to latest logs
- Limited history (50 entries) for better performance

### 4. Progress Tracking
- Current epoch and batch information
- Loss values (current and average)
- Percentage completion within epochs
- Training status updates

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components
1. **TrainingManager** (`train.py`)
   - Handles model training process
   - Manages training state and callbacks
   - Implements logging and progress tracking
   - Provides graceful training interruption

2. **Dataset Handler** (`dataset.py`)
   - Manages Fashion MNIST dataset
   - Handles data loading and preprocessing
   - Provides data loaders for training

3. **Model Architecture** (`model.py`)
   - Implements CNN architecture
   - Defines model structure and forward pass

### Frontend Components
1. **Interactive UI** (`index.html`)
   - Clean, responsive design
   - Progress indicators
   - Control buttons
   - Status messages
   - Chart visualization
   - Log display

2. **Real-time Updates** (`script.js`)
   - WebSocket communication
   - Chart.js integration
   - Dynamic log updates
   - Interactive controls
   - Real-time data visualization

## Setup and Usage

1. **Installation**   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt   ```

2. **Starting the System**   ```bash
   python main.py   ```

3. **Training Process**
   1. Click "Download & Prepare Dataset" to get Fashion MNIST data
   2. Once dataset is ready, "Start Training" button becomes active
   3. Click "Start Training" to begin the training process
   4. Monitor progress through:
      - Real-time loss plot
      - Live logs
      - Progress indicators
   5. After training, use "Get Predictions" to test the model

## Technical Features
