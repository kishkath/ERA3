Semiconductors are materials that have electrical conductivity between that of a conductor (like copper) and an insulator (like glass), allowing them to control electric current in devices. Silicon, the most widely used semiconductor, has properties that can be altered by introducing impurities, a process called doping, to enhance conductivity. Semiconductors are the foundation of modern electronics, enabling the creation of components such as transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits, which are essential in devices from smartphones to computers. Their ability to switch and amplify electrical signals makes them crucial for processing and storing information, leading to advancements in computing, communication, and energy systems. Additionally, semiconductors are integral to solar cells, converting sunlight into electricity, which plays a significant role in renewable energy technologies.
