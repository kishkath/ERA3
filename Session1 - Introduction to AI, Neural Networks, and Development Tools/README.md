### Session 1 Assignment: 

üîè Problem Statement:

--------------------

      1. We saw 2 examples of using Cussor to make Chrome Extensions! Be creative, make something! 
            Here are some examples:
            Find and list the latest movies on NetFlix
            Find the next Cricket Match or F1 GrandPrix
            Change the font on any website to anything that you like!
            Make a clipboard that stores all of your "copy" texts on your browser
            A small web browser-based game!
      2. Do not spend more than 1 hour doing this, this may be too addictive! 
      3. Follow the steps. It's better to start from scratch, rather than to fix big. Next time improve your prompt!
      4. Once done, upload a short video of it working on YouTube and share the link (to capture the video, you can use "Snip & Sketch", OBS, etc) zip your folder and share the code.
          

üí° Define Problem:

 Create a chrome extension using cursor the AI. 
 
üö¶ Follow-up Process:
-----------------
 The directory structure describes in following way:

    Directory: 
    ---------
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cursor_video_dp.png
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md Details about the Process.

  Process:
  -------
  * The step by step process for creating a chrome extension using cursor the AI.
      * Know about cursor, the AI code editor: https://www.cursor.com/
      * Install the cursor Ai (UBUNTU): https://dev.to/mhbaando/how-to-install-cursor-the-ai-editor-on-linux-41dm
      * Setup the IDE environment.
      * Create a new directory and open up the the cursor with the created directory.
      * Click (Ctrl + I), such that a message pop-up box arises to write the prompt for creating any thing.
      * The code and files get created with the result, if the requirement is satifised after cross checking, apply the changes made and save it.
      * Upload the extension to chrome and make the usage.
        
              * extension creation:
                -------------------
                  A. Load the Extension into Chrome
                  B. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
                  C. Turn on Developer Mode (top right corner).
                  D. Click Load unpacked.
                  E. Select the folder (my_extension) containing your extension files.
                  F. Test the Extension, after loading, the extension icon will appear in the toolbar.
                  G. Click the icon, and the popup.html should appear.
                  H. Test the button interaction to confirm the alert works!
